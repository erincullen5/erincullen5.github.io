                        Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. The purpose of this project was to analyze weather data from a variety of cities across the globe and see how the weather varies as the latitude changes.

                        But, if pressed, how would you prove it? 

                        After working with the data set, I created a function that used the Open Weather Map API.
